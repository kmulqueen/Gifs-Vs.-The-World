# Gifs Vs. The World

GIFs VS. The World is an interactive online multiplayer game where players fill in the blanks of absurd questions and scenarios from the card game "Cards Against Humanity" with gifs, and then vote each round for whose gif they think was the funniest/most appropriate or whacky. The first player to reach a score of 10 or more votes wins the game. The motivation behind this project was to entertain ourselves and others by providing a game that gives everyone a break from the stresses of the world, and grants people permission to embrace the weirdness that lives within themselves and the internet. The end result is an entertaining and surprisingly competitive online multiplayer experience that is guaranteed to cause a lot of laughter and wtf moments.

# Rules
At least 3 players are required to play! Once all players are ready and have clicked "New Round", the game will begin. Players must search for gifs and submit the one they think will obtain the most votes. During this time, submitted gifs will have to option to receive votes. The player to reach 10+ votes first wins the game.


# Future Changes
Some changes we would like to make to this project going forward (aside from some basic functionality issues) are some general styling changes (display gifs in rows rather than one column). We would also like to add some functionality to make private lobbies so people have an option to create a private game with their friends rather than always playing with random people. Another improvement weâ€™d like to make is the ability to pick what the score should be to declare the winner and show a scoreboard that players can see.
